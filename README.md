# Real Time Face Mask Detection using Computer Vision
The main goal of this system is to detect the face mask of people using CCTV camera and send the data to the respective authority and visualize the result that how many people wear mask. 
This system is built to help the government or the respective authority to monitor the activity of wearing face mask in public places.
For this project we have trained 10k images and achieved 95% accuracy. 

Technology used : Python, OpenCV, MobileNet, TensorFlow, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook
